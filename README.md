# Challenges and Wins
This was our first time building an application in React, rather than Vanillas JS. It was a breath of fresh air to create something that allowed for reusable components. Learning how to test with cypress that was a challenge we would like to work on.

# Future Additions
- User can filter movies by rating, release date, and genre.
- User can search for a movie by title.
- User can add their own rating to the movie.
- Sad path testing.
