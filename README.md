# Rancid Tomatillos

## Overview
Rancid Tomatillos is a paired project built using React. The application allows the user to navigate to different "pages" or views via implementing React Router. 

On the home page, the user can view all movies and their average user rating. A user can click on various links that navigate the user to different "pages". These pages include an all movies page, movie details page and movie trailer page. 

Also on the home page, a random movie image displays on page load as the banner that provides links to navigate the user to view the random movie's details. The movie details "page" displays the movie's title, poster, overview, rating, and release date.

# Challenges and Wins
This was our first time building an application in React. In comparison to vanilla JavaScript, React is a breath of fresh air because of its ability to reuse components. 

Cypress testing was a bit of a challenge to learn and we hope to improve on testing sad paths in our application.

# Future Additions
- User can filter movies by rating, release date, and genre.
- User can search for a movie by title.
- User can add their own rating to the movie.
- Sad path testing.
